🌌 SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORER - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================

📦 WHAT YOU HAVE:
- Complete Solar System Explorer project with NASA API integration
- 3D visualization using Three.js
- AI Chatbot powered by OpenAI
- Backend API server with Express.js

🚀 SETUP STEPS:

1️⃣ EXTRACT THE PROJECT
   - Extract the solar-system-pro.tar.gz file OR use the solar-system-pro folder
   - You should have this structure:
     solar-system-pro/
     ├── backend/
     ├── frontend/
     └── README.md

2️⃣ GET API KEYS (REQUIRED!)
   
   A. NASA API Key (FREE):
      - Go to: https://api.nasa.gov
      - Sign up for a free API key
      - You'll get it instantly via email
   
   B. OpenAI API Key (PAID):
      - Go to: https://platform.openai.com
      - Create an account
      - Add payment method
      - Generate API key
      - Note: This is optional - the app will work without chatbot

3️⃣ CONFIGURE BACKEND
   - Open: backend/.env
   - Replace YOUR_NASA_API_KEY with your actual NASA key
   - Replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI key
   
   Example:
   NASA_KEY=abcd1234efgh5678
   OPENAI_KEY=sk-proj-abc123...

4️⃣ INSTALL & RUN BACKEND
   Open terminal/command prompt:
   
   cd solar-system-pro/backend
   npm install
   node server.js
   
   You should see: 🚀 Backend running on http://localhost:3000

5️⃣ RUN FRONTEND
   
   Option A - Using Live Server (Recommended):
   - Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   - Right-click on frontend/index.html
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   
   Option B - Using Python:
   cd solar-system-pro/frontend
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then open: http://localhost:8000
   
   Option C - Using Node:
   cd solar-system-pro/frontend
   npx serve
   # Then open the URL shown

6️⃣ USE THE APP
   - Select a date to see Earth's position
   - The 3D scene shows the Sun (yellow sphere)
   - Type questions in the chatbot about planets
   - Example: "What is Jupiter made of?"

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: npm install fails
Solution: Make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org)

Problem: CORS errors in browser
Solution: Make sure backend is running on port 3000

Problem: Chatbot not working
Solution: Check your OpenAI API key and make sure you have credits

Problem: Frontend shows blank page
Solution: Check browser console (F12) for errors. Make sure you're using a local server, not file://

Problem: "Cannot GET /planet-position"
Solution: Backend isn't running. Start it with: node server.js

📚 FEATURES TO TRY:

1. Date Selector:
   - Click the date input
   - Select different dates
   - Backend fetches real NASA data for that date

2. 3D Visualization:
   - Currently shows the Sun
   - You can extend this to show all planets

3. AI Chatbot:
   - Ask: "How far is Mars from Earth?"
   - Ask: "What are Saturn's rings made of?"
   - Ask: "Tell me about Venus"

🔧 NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS):

1. Add all 8 planets to the 3D scene
2. Make planets move based on NASA data
3. Add orbit lines
4. Show planet names on hover
5. Add zoom/pan controls
6. Display planet info cards
7. Add asteroid belt
8. Create planet comparison tool

📝 NOTES:

- The NASA Horizons API is FREE and has no rate limits
- OpenAI API costs money per request (~$0.002 per request for gpt-4o-mini)
- The frontend uses CDN for Three.js (no install needed)
- Backend runs on port 3000, frontend can be any port

💡 TIPS:

- Test the backend first using a tool like Postman
- Keep the backend terminal open while using the app
- Check browser DevTools (F12) Network tab for API calls
- Add console.log() statements for debugging

🆘 NEED HELP?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that Node.js is installed: node --version
2. Check that npm is installed: npm --version
3. Make sure ports 3000 is not in use
4. Verify .env file has real API keys (no quotes around values)
5. Look at browser console errors (F12)

HAPPY EXPLORING! 🚀🌍✨
